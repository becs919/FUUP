# FUUP
Front-End UX UI Project 

## 3 examples of reference/inspiration



## Explain who your target user is, and how the choices you’ve made solve a problem for them, address their preferences/needs, and are tailored to them.


## Wireframes (hand-drawn is fine) of your comp for mobile and desktop – we want to see your process and thinking.


## Final comps for mobile and desktop layouts built in Sketch. Button/hover/active states must be included (if and when applicable). Should be ready to hand-off to a dev team to build.
