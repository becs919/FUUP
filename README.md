## Explain who your target user is, and how the choices you’ve made solve a problem for them, address their preferences/needs, and are tailored to them.

Our target user for FitTracker is the average joe. It doesn't matter if you are a cross-fit champ or just signed up for your first 5K! Track your workouts and set your goals with FitTracker to reach your ideal you! 


## Wireframes (hand-drawn is fine) of your comp for mobile and desktop – we want to see your process and thinking.


## Final comps for mobile and desktop layouts built in Sketch. Button/hover/active states must be included (if and when applicable). Should be ready to hand-off to a dev team to build.
